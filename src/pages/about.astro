        I’m Sashreek Addanki, a University of Alberta student focused on building software systems and applied AI.

      <div class="about-body">
        <p>
          My work spans backend systems, low-level programming, and AI-driven features that move beyond research demos into
          usable applications. I’m especially interested in the engineering required to bridge AI research ideas with real
          software systems.
        </p>
        <p class="about-secondary">
          I like testing ideas through rapid prototyping and iteration. I’m currently building a social media productivity
          app called Streaks (see Projects), and I regularly practice algorithmic problem-solving to strengthen my
          foundations in data structures and algorithms.
        </p>
        <p class="about-secondary">
          I also work with RISC-V (RV32) assembly to deepen my understanding of systems-level execution and low-level
          software behavior.
