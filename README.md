# Portfolio Website

## Design Philosophy
This portfolio is intentionally minimal and text-forward. The layout prioritizes clarity and scanning speed, with restrained typography, generous spacing, and a monochrome palette that keeps attention on the content.

Interactions are quiet and purposeful: subtle hover states, minimal decoration, and consistent structure across pages. The goal is to feel calm, precise, and professional while keeping the focus on the work.
